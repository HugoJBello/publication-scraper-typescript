Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a means of investigating large datasets to identify patterns within \"big data\" that can determine the factors on suicide outcomes. Here, we use AI tools to extract the topic from (press and social) media text. However, news media articles lack of suicide tags. Using tweets with hashtags related to sucide, we train a neuronal model which identifies if a given text has a suicidade-related contagion. Our results suggest a high level of the impact of mediatic into suicide cases, and a intrinsic thematic relationship of suicide news. These results pave the way to build more interpretable suicide data, which may help to better track, understand its origin, and improve prevention strategies.","doi":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03727v1","date":"2021","journalType":"preprint","workType":"preprint"},{"title":"Diagnostic stability in Bipolar Disorder: A follow-up study in 130.000 patient-years","authors":"Authors: \nCegla-Schvartzman, Fanny ; Ovejero, Santiago; Lopez-Castroman, Jorge; Palomar-Ciria, Nora; Migoya-Borja, Marta ; Bello, Hugo J.; Mart√≠nez-Al√©s, Gonzalo; Baca-Garcia, Enrique","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry","doi":"","date":"2021","journalType":"journal-article","workType":"journal-article"},{"title":"Stress Salivary Biomarkers Answer During the Work Day in Emergencies  in Healthcare Professionals","authors":"Authors: \nAlfredo C√≥rdova *, Daniel P√©rez-Valdecantos, Alberto Caballero-Garc√≠a, Teodosia Del Castillo Sanz, Hugo J Bello, Enrique Roche","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":"","date":"2021","journalType":"journal-article","workType":"journal-article"},{"title":"Use of Ecological Momentary Assessment to study suicidal thoughts and behavior: A Systematic Review","authors":"Authors:\nAlba Sedano-Capdevila; Alejandro Porras-Segovia; Hugo J.

Many factors have been studied to generate or maintain this kind of violence, however, the influence of the media is still uncertain. Here, we use Machine Learning tools to extrapolate the effect of the news in GBV. By feeding neural networks with news, the topic information associated with each article can be recovered. Our findings show a relationship between GBV news and public awareness, the effect of mediatic GBV cases, and the intrinsic thematic relationship of GBV news. Because the used neural model can be easily adjusted, this also allows us to extend our approach to other media sources or topics","doi":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07490v1","date":"2020","journalType":"preprint","workType":"preprint"},{"title":"Early administration of aripiprazole long-acting injectable in acute inpatients with schizophrenia: a clinical report","journal":"International Clinical Psychopharmacology","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1097/yic.0000000000000345","date":"2020","journalType":"journal-article","workType":"journal-article"},{"title":"Superheroes, resilience and COVID-19","journal":"Actualidad M√©dica","doi":"","date":"2020","journalType":"journal-article","workType":"journal-article"},{"title":"Diagnostic stability of schizophrenia: A systematic review","journal":"Psychiatry Research","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2019.04.020","date":"2019","journalType":"journal-article","workType":"journal-article"},{"title":"On local cross sections in topological abelian groups","journal":"Revista de la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, F√≠sicas y Naturales.
